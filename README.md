# Machine Learning & Deep Learning Project

This repository contains my course project for **Introduction to Machine Learning and Deep Learning with Python**, instructed by [Dr. Amir Zamanidoost](https://github.com/Amirzamani4096/Zamanidoost_project).

## About the Project
Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Neural Networks (NN) are rapidly becoming essential tools across nearly every field of science and engineering.  
In this project, I explored fundamental concepts of ML and DL using Python, applying theoretical knowledge to hands-on coding tasks. The work presented here represents both the learning process and the implementation of key algorithms introduced in the course.

## Contents
- Python implementations of ML & DL models
- Notebooks with code, explanations, and results
- Example datasets used during the course
- Supporting scripts and documentation presented in the class

## Acknowledgment
I would like to thank **Dr. Amir Zamanidoost** for his guidance and for providing the foundation of this project through the course material. His original project repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Amirzamani4096/Zamanidoost_project).
